# CellScan — 4-Channel 18650 Battery Analyzer

## What It Does
CellScan tests up to 4 18650 lithium-ion cells simultaneously.
Each channel measures voltage, capacity (mAh), and internal resistance.
Results display on an OLED screen and a live WiFi dashboard hosted
by an ESP32, where you can start and stop tests per channel.

## Why I Built This
My science fair project was a 3S34P battery pack built from 34 salvaged
18650 cells. I bought a tester from Amazon but I wanted to understand how
it actually works and build one myself with 4 parallel channels so I could
test one series row at a time.

## How Each Measurement Works

**Voltage** — INA219 reads cell terminal voltage continuously every 500ms

**Capacity (mAh)** — ESP32 switches MOSFET on to start discharge through
load resistor. INA219 measures current. Capacity accumulates using coulomb
counting: `mAh += current_A * (elapsed_ms / 3600000.0)` every 500ms until
the cell hits the cutoff voltage.

**Internal Resistance** — Measured at test start using the voltage sag:
1. MOSFET off → read open circuit voltage (V_oc)
2. MOSFET on → wait 100ms → read loaded voltage (V_load) and current (I)
3. `R_int (mΩ) = (V_oc - V_load) / I * 1000`
